Code related to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01181): "Graph Isomorphic Networks for Assessing Reliability of the Medium-Voltage Grid." by Cambier van Nooten, C., van de Poll, T., FÃ¼llhase, S., Heres, J., Heskes, T., & Shapovalova, Y. 

![General pipeline of the proposed framework](illustrations/pipeline_gin.drawio.png)

Graph Isomorphic Networks for assessing the N-1 principle on energy grids. Case study on a medium-voltage grid of a Distribution System Operator (DSO) in the Netherlands (Alliander). 

Disclaimer : This code demonstrates the main algorithm (GIN) in a barebone manner. Please contact us if there are any questions.

## Datasets
Real grid data (obtained from Alliander, DSO in the Netherlands) together with augmented data.

## GIN framework 

###  GIN layer details (supplementary material)
See the figures below for complementary illustrations of the GIN equations mentioned in the paper.

<sup><sub>Fig 4. Apply the first MLPs in the first layer ($k=0$). Apply aggregation (and combining in the second layer ($k=1$), for both the nodes and edges. For simplification, only the 1-hop neighbourhood of node $v$ is considered. In the real method, we considered these steps for all nodes and edges.</sub></sup>
