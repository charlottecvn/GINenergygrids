# GINenergygrids

![General pipeline of the proposed framework](pipeline_gin.drawio.png)

Graph Neural Networks for assessing the N-1 principle on energy grids. Case study on a medium-voltage grid of a DSO (Alliander). Created as part of my PhD at Radboud University and AI for Energy Grids Lab.
This repository demonstrates the main algorithm in a barebone manner.

See [here]() for further illustrative examples of the GIN equations.
